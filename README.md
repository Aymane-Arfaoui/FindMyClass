# Welcome to our ConUMaps Mobile Application ðŸ‘‹

---

## Project Description:
ConUMaps is a mobile application designed to help Concordia University students easily navigate their way around campus. This app provides an interactive map of the university, to help students locating buildings, classrooms, and other key facilities. With real-time directions, students can quickly find the shortest path to their next class or destination directly from their phone.

It can also help the students to navigate around both Loyola and SGW campuses and find the nearest Points of Interest indoor and outdoor. Finally, they can check their calendar to get directions to their next class marked on their calendar, and they can plan multiple tasks using the Smart Planner that will provide the fastest route to finish all the selected tasks.
