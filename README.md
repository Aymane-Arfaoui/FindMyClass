## Project Description:
Find My Class is a mobile application designed to help Concordia University students easily navigate their way around campus. This app provides an interactive map of the university, to help students locating buildings, classrooms, and other key facilities. With real-time directions, students can quickly find the shortest path to their next class or destination directly from their phone.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
